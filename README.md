**Abstract**


Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) is a spectrum of visual impairments caused by damage to
some parts of the visual brain, namely, the totality of brain elements that serve or support vision.
In the present thesis, we aim to analyze whether the clutter within one of the serious game interfaces
developed by iVision’s research team, contributes to visual fatigue in children with CVI, potentially
affecting player performance and engagement. By applying various measures of clutter to the game’s
scenes, we can study the correlation between visual complexity and player performance metrics.
By using the Unsupervised Activation Energy method, we aimed to test the superiority of the
intermediate-level features of convolutional neural networks as a way to predict visual complexity,
as well as their generalization to other types of datasets. Our findings indicated that although
certain metrics might serve as supplementary indicators of the difficulty level assigned to an image,
to know the exact influence these factors have on a child’s visual fatigue and gameplay still requires
to conduct analyses from alternative standpoints. Our results also highlighted the importance of
tailoring gameplay to the visuoperceptual profiles of the children, as their initial difficulty levels
seem to play a central role in their performance outcomes.
